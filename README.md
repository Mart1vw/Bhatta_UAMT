Welcome to this repository ! It aims at giving any interested researcher the tools needed to reproduce results from our paper ["On the pitfalls of entropy-based uncertainty for multi-class semi-supervised segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03587.pdf).

All of the main elements required to train the network are in the "main.py" function as one might expect. Please note that this is a working version and that some minor changes were made in our private repository but not here (mainly code cleaning) for administrative reasons.

The dataset we used is available [here](http://www.developingconnectome.org/data-release/second-data-release/) and is available to anyone willing to set up an account.

If you have any questions regarding the code or the article, please feel free to contact me at martin.wrbk@gmail.com.
