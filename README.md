Welcome to this repository ! It aims at giving any interested researcher the tools needed to reproduce results from our paper ["On the pitfalls of entropy-based uncertainty for multi-class semi-supervised segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03587.pdf).

All of the main elements required to train the network are in the "main.py" function as one might expect.

The dataset we used is available [here](http://www.developingconnectome.org/data-release/second-data-release/) to anyone willing to set-up an account. Running the program will require to use a GPU (16+ Gb of VRAM if possible) and change all of the paths in the arguments.

If you have any questions regarding the code or the article, please feel free to contact me (email on my homepage).
